## Create Local Docker Clusters (CAPD)

‚ö†Ô∏è: TCE's support for Cluster-API Docker (CAPD) is **experimental** and may require troubleshooting on your system.

In order to use CAPD, you should ensure your Docker engine has plenty of resources and storage available.
We do not have exact numbers at this time, but most modern laptops and desktops should be able to run this configuration.
Even with a modern system, there is always potential you're using up most or all of what Docker has allocated. **For your
best chance at success, you may wish to do the steps marked `(Optional)`.**

1. Ensure your Docker engine has >= 6GB of RAM and 4+ CPUs. This is especially critical for Mac users, below you can see a screenshot from Docker Desktop's settings.

   ![docker settings](/docs/img/docker-settings.png)

   > These are the minimal settings we validated against with not other containers running.

1. (Optional): Stop all existing containers.

   ```shell
   docker kill $(docker ps -q)
   ```

1. (Optional): Prune all existing containers, volumes, and images

   ```sh
    docker system prune -a --volumes
   ```

   > Read the prompt carefully, this will erase a majority of what is cached in your Docker environment.
   > While this will ensure your environment is clean before starting, it will also significantly increase bootstrapping
   > time if you already had the docker images downloaded.

1. Create a cluster names that will be used throughout this getting-started.md guide. This instance of `MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME` should be set to whatever value is returned by `tanzu management-cluster get` above.

    ```sh
    export MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME="<INSERT_MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME_HERE>"
    export GUEST_CLUSTER_NAME="<INSERT_GUEST_CLUSTER_NAME_HERE>"
    ```

1. Create a Docker-based management cluster

   ```sh
   tanzu management-cluster create -i docker --name ${MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME} -v 10 --plan dev --ceip-participation=false
   ```

   > If you ran the `prune` command in the previous step, expect this to take some time, as it'll download an image that is over 1GB.

1. Capture the management cluster's kubeconfig.

    ```sh
    tanzu management-cluster kubeconfig get ${MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME} --admin

    Credentials of workload cluster 'mtce' have been saved
    You can now access the cluster by running 'kubectl config use-context mtce-admin@mtce'
    ```

   > Note the context name `${MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME}-admin@mtce`, you'll use the above command in
   > future steps. Your management cluster name may be different than
   > `${MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME}`.

1. Set your kubectl context to the management cluster.

    ```sh
    kubectl config use-context ${MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME}-admin@${MGMT_CLUSTER_NAME}
    ```

1. Validate you can access the management cluster's API server.

    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes

    NAME                         STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
    guest-control-plane-tcjk2    Ready    control-plane,master   59m   v1.20.4+vmware.1
    guest-md-0-f68799ffd-lpqsh   Ready    <none>                 59m   v1.20.4+vmware.1
    ```

1. Create your guest cluster.

   ```shell
   tanzu cluster create ${GUEST_CLUSTER_NAME} --plan dev
   ```

1. Validate the cluster starts successfully.

    ```sh
    tanzu cluster list
    ```

1. Capture the guest cluster's kubeconfig.

    ```sh
    tanzu cluster kubeconfig get ${GUEST_CLUSTER_NAME} --admin
    ```

1. Set your `kubectl` context accordingly.

    ```sh
    kubectl config use-context ${GUEST_CLUSTER_NAME}-admin@${GUEST_CLUSTER_NAME}
    ```

1. Verify you can see pods in the cluster.

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

    NAMESPACE     NAME                                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    kube-system   antrea-agent-9d4db                                      2/2     Running   0          3m42s
    kube-system   antrea-agent-vkgt4                                      2/2     Running   1          5m48s
    kube-system   antrea-controller-5d594c5cc7-vn5gt                      1/1     Running   0          5m49s
    kube-system   coredns-5d6f7c958-hs6vr                                 1/1     Running   0          5m49s
    kube-system   coredns-5d6f7c958-xf6cl                                 1/1     Running   0          5m49s
    kube-system   etcd-tce-guest-control-plane-b2wsf                      1/1     Running   0          5m56s
    kube-system   kube-apiserver-tce-guest-control-plane-b2wsf            1/1     Running   0          5m56s
    kube-system   kube-controller-manager-tce-guest-control-plane-b2wsf   1/1     Running   0          5m56s
    kube-system   kube-proxy-9825q                                        1/1     Running   0          5m48s
    kube-system   kube-proxy-wfktm                                        1/1     Running   0          3m42s
    kube-system   kube-scheduler-tce-guest-control-plane-b2wsf            1/1     Running   0          5m56s
    ```

With the above done, you now have local clusters running atop Docker. The nodes can be seen by running a command as follows.

```shell
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                         COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS             PORTS                                  NAMES

```

The above reflects 1 management cluster and 1 workload cluster, both featuring 1 control plane node and 1 worker node.
Each cluster gets an `haproxy` container fronting the control plane node(s). This enables scaling the control plane into
an HA configuration.

üõ†Ô∏è: For troubleshooting failed bootstraps, you can exec into a container and use the kubeconfig at `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf` to access
the API server directly. For example:

```shell
$ docker exec -it 4ae /bin/bash

root@guest-control-plane-tcjk2:/# kubectl --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf get nodes

NAME                         STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
guest-control-plane-tcjk2    Ready    control-plane,master   67m   v1.20.4+vmware.1
guest-md-0-f68799ffd-lpqsh   Ready    <none>                 67m   v1.20.4+vmware.1
```

> In the above `4ae` is a control plane node.
